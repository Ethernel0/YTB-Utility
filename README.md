Be sure that you have Python and Pip installed (just open a terminal and type in python -h or pip -h)
And install the required packages : pyperclip, pytube (pip install pyperclip or pytube)

### How to use the YT-Utility Python script ?:
```
-h for possible commands
-s to start the clipboard to file module
-p to parse a YouTube playlist (only public playlist!)
-c clear the selected file (ex: clipboard-url-repo.txt or playlist-url-repo.txt)
^ premade user input you can choose "cb" or "pl" | cb = clipboard / pl = playlist
```

In this case you can use this public tool:
